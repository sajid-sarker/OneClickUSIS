# OneClickUSIS
A simple web scraping app that checks if seats are available for selected courses on USIS

First create a .txt file and name it "course_input.txt".
Type the course and the intended section with a space between them. Each course should should be in a new line.
Sample:

Make sure the txt file is in the same directory as the program.

Note: the default interval between checks is 90 seconds. You may change that in the code.
